		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Hello, I am olligobber. I also go by Lillie, and prefer she/her pronouns. I am from Sydney, Australia. I am a mathematician and programmer who enjoys the connections between the two, as well as other areas such as music and visual design. My favorite areas of maths are category theory, logic, and algebra. My favorite programming languages are Lean, Haskell, PureScript, and Typst, but I'll be ok with Rust if I need good performance.</p>
		<p>My other interests include cute animals, nature, cooking, crafts, fiction, board games and video games. I have a cat called Onyxx, who is the sweetest most loving cat I've ever met. I help run an OldSchool RuneScape clan called Fe Nix, mainly acting as the techy one that runs the website and writes code for managing our growing list of members.</p>
		<p>On this blog, I'll be posting about my many projects in maths and programming that I've worked on over the years. I post memes, thoughts, and updates on my projects on <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@olligobber">Mastodon</a>, and I post all my code on <a href="https://github.com/olligobber">Github</a>.</p>
